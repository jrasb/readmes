## Quick level guide
- Ranks 1-5: Camp in southern Gaptooth Ridge, and run back-to-back local deliveries for 200 XP (amount of goods doesn't matter).

- Ranks 6-10: Get the medium wagon and run 26-good deliveries for 1000 XP. This may be slightly slower, but gives you time to do other things.

- Ranks 11+: Get the large wagon and do 100-good large deliveries. It's slower for XP, but beyond rank 11 there's not much worth grinding for.
