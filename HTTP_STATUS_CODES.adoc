| 101 | Switching Protocols
| The requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server has agreed to do so

| 102 | Processing
| Indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet

| 103 | Early Hints
| Used to return some response headers before final HTTP message

|||

| 200 | OK
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests

| 201 | Created
| The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource

| 202 | Accepted
| The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might
not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs.

| 203 | Non-Authoritative Information
| The server is a transforming proxy that received a 200 OK from its origin, but is returning a modified version of the
origin's response

| 204 | No Content
| The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content

| 205 | Reset Content
| The server successfully processed the request, asks that the requester reset its document view, and is not returning
any content

| 206 | Partial Content
| The server  is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client

| 207 | Multi-Status
| The message body that follows is by default an XML message and can contain a number of separate response codes,
depending on how many sub-requests were made

| 208 | Already Reported

not being included again

instance-manipulations applied to the current instance

|||
